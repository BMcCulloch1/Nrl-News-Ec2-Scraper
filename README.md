# NRL News Scraper

A small Python project that scrapes National Rugby League (NRL) and Zero Tackle news, saves the articles as JSON, and uploads the results to an AWS S3 bucket. Itâ€™s designed to run automatically on an EC2 instance.

## What It Does

- Scrapes articles from NRL and Zero Tackle using Playwright + BeautifulSoup  
- Merges and sorts results by timestamp  
- Removes duplicate articles (based on URL)  
- Saves two files:
  - `latest_nrl_news.json`: 5 newest articles per source  
  - `all_nrl_news.json`: full history of articles (deduplicated)  
- Uploads both files to an S3 bucket using `boto3`

## Cron Setup

This project uses two cron jobs on EC2:

- **Hourly**: Runs the scraper every hour  

To set up the cron jobs:

```bash
crontab crontab.txt
